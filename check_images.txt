Answer: All 3 models preformed perfectly for this test, identifying both dog images and non dog images correctly, so the only other way to judge these models as by the time it took them to run and return the classifications. 
VGG model's total elapsed runtime was 00:00:03, but it was 00:00:00 for the other 2 models, so from this we casn say that Alexent and Resnet models outpreform VGG slightly by being faster to run and are the best.
